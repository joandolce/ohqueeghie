The subjects of the series range from hauntings to monsters to supernatural occurrences and everything in between.

This is one of the least cluttered anthologies I've seen recently, with only three stories, and the wrap around which doesn't take up much time. This is a good and detrimental thing, every story gets a little room to breathe; but there is also less material in case something doesn't live up to expectations.
